This folder stores the images as well as the train.txt and test.txt for fine-tuning on Microsoft CoCo dataset Food Images.

I just extract all the food images from CoCo dataset in train2014 and val2014 as the training set and testing set, then I used the labels for result, the accuracy is 50.28% for 10 category in 60,000 iterations.

**This shows that the experiment works well for my dataset and accuracy is also good and resonable**
